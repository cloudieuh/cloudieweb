Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) is a Japanese national university located in Kansai Science City, Japan. On march until June 2019, I got an opportunity to do a Reseach Internship on Cyber Resilience lab at NAIST.  I was supervised by Dr. Doudou Fall and Dr. Shigeru Kashihara to do a project for making new GUI for finding victims through drones video by a machine learning algorithm called YOLO. In this project I was learned how to make an efficient object detection on video by extracting the images from the video, as we know for processing video detection we need to use high specification hardware and long-time process depends on hardware specification. So I propose a method for processing video with an extraction method for making the processing time faster and computational process lighter.

Because of this internship, I got a great experience including new friends from Japan, Tanzania, Thailand, Senegal, and France. I think it will be tough for me to talk with sensei because of the limitation of language, but fortunately, all the sensei's in the lab can speak English fluently. The other things that I learned from my Internship at NAIST were how to do improve my research every week, how to manage time well, and how I can focus on what I am doing. Big thanks to Dr. Muhammad Niswar for giving me this chance.
