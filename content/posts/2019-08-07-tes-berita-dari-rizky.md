  During the three month course, I did research on LoRa Performance, an emerging
  technology in the IoT field. LoRa is a Low-Power Wide-Area-Network Protocol
  that enables IoT devices to become more efficient. The environment where the
  LoRa devices deployed plays a huge role in communication performance. So the
  focus of my research was developing a framework for measuring LoRa Performance
  on-site or off-site.

I was doing my internship at the Cyber Resilience Lab, Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and  Technology from June to August 2018. 



During the three month course, I did research on LoRa Performance, an emerging technology in the IoT field. LoRa is a Low-Power Wide-Area-Network Protocol that enables IoT devices to become more efficient. The environment where the LoRa devices deployed plays a huge role in communication performance. So the focus of my research was developing a framework for measuring LoRa Performance on-site or off-site.



Cyber Resilience Lab facilitated me from references to the tools that I used during my research. Shigeru Kashihara-sensei and Doudou Fall-sensei supervised me on my research. I reported my progress to them weekly. 



The output of my research was a paper titled "LouPe: LoRa Performance Measurement Tool " that I present in 2nd EAST INDONESIA CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIConCIT) 2018. The conference committee awarded me with the best speaker on EIConCIT 2018.



I learned a lot during my time in NAIST. I learned how to tackle problems systemically and how to write a good research paper. I've always loved Japan's culture, it was really fun. I also made new friends that I still in contact with.



I would like to say thank you very much to everyone for making it such a wonderful experience. Thanks to NAIST, Cyber Resilience Lab, JASSO, and Pak Niswar for trusting me with the opportunity.



Tanoshikatta!
