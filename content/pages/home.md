We developed an IoT-based water quality monitoring system for blue swimmer and mud crab farming. Our proposed system consists of small embedded devices (Raspberry and Arduino), multiple water quality sensors and LoRa wireless interfaces.

The system uses a lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for exchanging messages between small embedded devices, mobile devices, and sensors. We use water temperature sensor, pH sensor, and salinity sensor for monitoring the water quality in the pond. Sensors are connected to small embedded devices and a Mosquito based MQTT broker is established for remote monitoring. Moreover, we also established a cloud-based database for storing data from sensors to produce datasets.
