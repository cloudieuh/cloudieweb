subtitle: "## Problem\n\nFarming of blue swimmer soft shell crab has been practiced in south-east Asian countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Philippines. Soft shell crabs are harvested when they have just molted to prevent their shells from being hardened. Unfortunately, farmer are experiencing a low survival rate of larva and adult crab. The factor contributes in low survival rate of the crab is water quality including water temperatures and salinity. Farmer must maintain water quality in terms of temperatures, salinities, pH, ammonium and oxygen. Unfortunately, traditional farming cannot increase the survival rate of the blue swimmer crab due to lack of monitoring and control of water quality.  \n\nMoreover, farmers need to feed the crabs with accurate portion of food. However, farmers sometimes provide incorrect amounts of food to the crabs. Such exceeding feed results in food wastage and dirty water in the crabsâ€™ cage, hence, the crabs may be sick from drinking the dirty water. On the other hand, if farmers feed the crabs less than the required amounts of food, there will be slow growth of the crabs. Furthermore, farmer need an immediate notification when crab is molted in order to prevent their shells from being hardened. This project develops an automation system to feed the crabs properly and monitor as well as control their environment to achieve higher yield of crab.\n\n## Goal\n\nThis project aims to:\r\n\n* Maintain optimal water conditions for crab to achieve higher yield using IoT Technology by building a live water monitoring and control system through mobile devices and PC \r\n* Alerts and notifications when water parameters are not suitable \r\n* Monitor the development of crab larva to detect Megalopa phase larval using image processing & Artificial Intelligent to reduce cannibalism in larva stage development.\r\n* Create environmental quality datasets for forecasting to increase the yields of soft shell crabs as well as for research and scientific discoveries"

  ## Approach


  We developed an IoT-based water quality monitoring system for blue swimmer and
  mud crab farming. Our proposed system consists of small embedded devices
  (Raspberry and Arduino), multiple water quality sensors and LoRa wireless
  interfaces. 


  The system uses a lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
  protocol for exchanging messages between small embedded devices, mobile
  devices, and sensors. We use water temperature sensor, pH sensor, and salinity
  sensor for monitoring the water quality in the pond. Sensors are connected to
  small embedded devices and a Mosquito based MQTT broker is established for
  remote monitoring. Moreover, we also established a cloud-based database for
  storing data from sensors to produce datasets.
