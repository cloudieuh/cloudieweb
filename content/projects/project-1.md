  Farming of blue swimmer and mud crab for producing soft shell crab has been
  practiced in south-east Asian countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar,
  Vietnam, and Philippines. Soft shell crabs are harvested when they have just
  molted to prevent their shells from being hardened. Unfortunately, farmers are
  experiencing a low survival rate of larval development stage and adult crab.
  The factor contribute in low survival rate of the crab is a poor water quality
  and incorrect feeding.


  \

  We developed an IoT-based water quality monitoring and control system for blue
  swimmer and mud crab farming. Our proposed system consists of small embedded
  devices (Raspberry and Arduino), multiple water quality sensors and LoRa
  wireless interfaces. The system uses a lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry
  Transport (MQTT) protocol for exchanging messages between small embedded
  devices, mobile devices, and sensors. We use water temperature sensor, pH
  sensor, and salinity sensor for monitoring the water quality in the pond.
  Sensors are connected to small embedded devices and a Mosquito based MQTT
  broker is established for remote monitoring. Moreover, we also established a
  cloud-based database for storing data from sensors to produce datasets.
